## My Personal Mission

<https://www.facebook.com/notes/1054470145004848/>

> My mission: help geeks feels safe in the world.
> Everything Iâ€™ve done fits somehow:
>
> - **Patterns**.
> Isolate the repeating parts of problems and solutions
> so the unique aspects come into clearer focus.
>
> - **xUnit**.
> Transmute worry into tests that replicate confidence.
>
> - **TDD**.
> Break overwhelming problems into a stream of
> test-code-design-test-code-design.
> Extreme Programming. Create a rhythm and structure
> for safe social interaction that results in solved problems
> (often involving code).
>
> - **3X Explore/Expand/Extract**.
> Fit the punishment to the crime.
> Neither over- nor under-do rigor, creativity, safety, planning, and reaction.
